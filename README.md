## <font color="#8BE">Future of the Project</font>

---
- **First milestone is almost completed:**
There are just few things left to do such as implementing the service layers
  and finishing rest of the unit tests. I only wrote unit tests of PaintingController.
  This project is not TDD. I am writing them later to practice unit testing.
  

- **Second milestone with Spring Security:** In the second version my priority is extending the project with Spring Security and improving my testing skills.


- **Third milestone and later:** After the second version, my first aim is to learn and integrate
React JS to the project. For the later version I will try to implement new things
  that I learned to the app.
